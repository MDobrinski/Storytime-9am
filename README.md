# Storytime 9:00 am Class

Good morning, class!  Today we are going to be writing a fairy tale!
The rules are simple:

1. Everyone adds **one** sentence to the story on a new line at the end.
2. Only after you have submitted your sentence can you go back and edit it.
3. You can **not** change some one elses sentence, 
unless to correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc., but you cannot change the meaning.
4. When the story is "complete", we will print it out and take a vote on which class wrote the best story.  The winner will get candy.
